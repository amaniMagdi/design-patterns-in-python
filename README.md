# design-patterns-in-python
Understanding design patterns and implementing them in python with code examples.
Mainly I used the following site for this mission: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

**Classification of patterns**

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    * Factory Method
    * Abstract Factory
    * Builder
    * Singleton

- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
